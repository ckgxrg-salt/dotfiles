# My NixOS Configuration Dotfiles
This is mainly used to remotely store and sync my configurations across all my devices.
I also included some packages and modules that are not included in nixpkgs from my another repository [ckgpkgs](https://github.com/ckgxrg-salt/ckgpkgs).
Feel free to refer to my configurations, but don't expect they'll work out of box on your device.

### TODO: 
1. Migrate to UWSM
2. Remove Daywatchman's waybar, use AGS instead
3. Wrap MPC using AGS
inf. Probably try to migrate to BSD
