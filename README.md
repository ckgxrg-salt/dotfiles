# My NixOS Configuration Dotfiles
This is mainly used to remotely store and sync my configurations across all my devices.  
I also included some packages that are not included in nixpkgs.  
Feel free to refer to my configurations, but don't expect they'll work out of box on your device.

### TODO
1. Remove Daywarden's waybar, use ags instead
2. Modularise Alacritty
